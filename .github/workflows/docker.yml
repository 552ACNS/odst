#TODO set up tags properly (which are currently specified in the nx docker command)
#so that all branches aren't being built to the same tags. I often put other branches as triggers up above,
#since it makes it easy to debug/deploy test images. Which is (currently) bad, since those test images are tagged as production.
#Setting tag bases on current branch would also be a safety net,
#since currently if anyone runs "nx docker" on any branch, it pushes to the tags meant for our real production images

#TODO is there a way to test if image can be built based on PR code? without doing the whole pipeline.
#Could just build images and not push to registry. Or push under a tag based on branch (same as the above TODO)
